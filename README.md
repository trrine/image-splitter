### Executing the Program
The program runs from the command line where the user provides the filename/path of the image to be split and the number of new output images from the split as arguments. 
The new images are saved in the same location as the original image. It is only possible for the user to choose a number divisible by 4, such as 4, 16, 32. To split a given image into four new images, type the following command:
- image_splitter.py imagefile 4
- E.g. image_splitter.py image1.jpg 4
